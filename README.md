# ping-pong
I've developed a Ping Pong game implemented using Python language.



this is a Practical application of the basics of the Python language .




I have used Turtle module in this application .

The rules of this game are:

1-There are two players.
2-Both have control over the paddle of their side.
3-They can move the paddle on vertical sides from up to down and down to up.


controls for player1 are :
 
                          " w "              for Up            and       " s "               for Down. 
                          
controls for player2 are :
 
                         "Up arrow key "     for Up            and      "Down arrow key"      for Down.
